Facial detection also called facial detection, is an artificial intelligence (AI)-based computer technology used to find and identify human faces in digital images and video.
OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. which is built to provide a common infrastructure for machine learning algorithms and computer vision. It has thousands of optimized algorithms which can be used different purposes like detecting and recognizing faces, identifying objects and many more. We need it to take pictures using our webcam and some manipulation needed to be done in the image.
To install the library you need to install pip in your system after that you can follow the steps in command prompt: 
pip install opencv-contrib-python
